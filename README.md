## Getting Started

First, open [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/oshadhi-vanodhya/project-calculator?file=.next%2Fstatic%2Fcss%2Fapp%2Flayout.css) with your browser to see the result.


Second, run the development server if needed:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.




## How to add your ChatGPT API key

**Step 1: Create the ```.env.local``` file**

Navigate to Your Project Root: Open your project directory in your terminal or file explorer.
Create the ```.env.local``` File: If it doesn't already exist, create a new file named ```.env.local.```




          

**Step 2: Add Your API Key**

[`Create an API key`](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and copy the Secret key 

Open the ```.env.local``` File.

Add the API Key: Write the following line in the file, replacing **YOUR_API_KEY** with your actual ChatGPT API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```





**Step 3: Save the File**
Save the Changes: After adding the API key, save the file.

**Important Notes:**
Keep the ```.env.local``` File Secret: Ensure this file is included in your .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to version control.
